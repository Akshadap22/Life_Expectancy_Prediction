# Life_Expectancy_Prediction

To train a linear regression model for life expectancy prediction, a dataset of life expectancy values and associated independent variables must first be collected and preprocessed. This may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing or standardizing the data to ensure that all variables are on the same scale.

Once the data is ready, the model can be trained using the linear regression algorithm. The model then uses this training data to identify the coefficients that describe the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data points by inputting the values of the independent variables.

Life expectancy prediction using linear regression can provide valuable insights into how various factors impact life expectancy, which can be useful in developing public health policies and interventions to improve overall health outcomes.
